Grand total of sleep for last night: 4h 39m. Did I even enjoy the rest that I got? According to the data, the answer is no.

<a href="http://www.frymanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/sleepgraph.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-20 alignright" title="Sleep Graph" src="http://www.frymanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/sleepgraph.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="201" /></a>

Apparently at some point, my body decided that the pain of 13 hours jetlag wasn't enough, and decided it would be cool to have a 20 hour day. Needless to say, today was tough. I almost fell asleep in two interviews - the first because they were not engaging, and the second just out of pure exhaustion. You know when your eye begins to twitch you're so tired... that kind of exhaustion.

<!--more-->I realized today that Filipinos really enjoy their sweets. I should have found that pretty evident the last time I was here and enjoyed one of their national treats - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo-halo">Halo-Halo</a>, (lit: Mix-Mix). However, I was really reminded of this by another mistaken treasure of the Philippines - Krispy Kreme. The best part about it is that it's not enough to just eat overly sugared fried bread with creme on top and/or inside in typical KK fashion, Krispy Kreme has to do a sugar remix. So without further ado, please let me introduce: KitKat Kreme, Oreo Choco Doughnut, White Chocolate Glazed, and some other nameless abomination.

Dare I say anymore?

On the food-front, today was a breakthrough day. Apparently, I went to the wrong shopping center, and was completely overwhelmed by the chaos that was Shoe Mart (SM) Supermarket. I should have gone to <em>Rustans</em> Supermarket, duh! Instead of taking a left at the corner of my apartment/mall, I took a right, ended up in a place that I could easily shop at. The contrast was literally Dollar General (SM) vs. KroegerÂ with a mini-Publix inside (the inside had an organic only side shop for all of your organic needs). While I was inside, I was introduced by what can only be described as, yes you guessed it, the SPAM section.

<a href="http://www.frymanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0192.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-24" title="SPAM!" src="http://www.frymanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0192-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>I actually welled up a bit at this sight. Not nearly as extensive as the Guam stores, but well on its way. Notable treasured flavors in here include: Bacon, Cheese, Hot &amp; Spicy (yes, please), Garlic, Hickory Smoke, and Black Pepper.

All in all, I ended up with a fairly descent take. My goal was to create a Philipino version of Frito Pie. The goal was to replace Fritos with <a href="http://filipino-store.com/index.php?act=viewCat&amp;catId=8">Chippy</a>! Chippy is a corn chip Frito style, however it's already seasoned with BBQ flavor. YUM! This should go fantastic. So, enter into the bin the following items:
<ol>
	<li>1x can of chili (Hot)</li>
	<li>1x tin of Hot-and-Spicy SPAM</li>
	<li>1x bag (small) of Chippy!</li>
	<li>1x bottle of Orange C2</li>
	<li>1x bottle of Ragu Meat Flavored (tm) spaghetti sauce</li>
	<li>Condiments (Ketchup/Mustard/Kosher Dill Slices)</li>
	<li>1x bag of Bread</li>
	<li>1x bag of hamburger buns</li>
	<li>1x jar of Peanut Butter</li>
	<li>1x jar of Concord Grape Jelly</li>
	<li>1 kg of Sirloin Beef</li>
	<li>1 package of Spaghetti noodles</li>
</ol>
Total take: PHP 1399.24, or about $31. Could have done better, but given the trauma that I had last night, I was okay with it. I figure I have a few days of meals ahead of me without having to worry too much. Now I only have to worry about dishes.

And to leave you, the Philipino style Chippy! pie is pretty good. Actually, it's pretty bad, but I'll be damned if I'm going to let the Philippines take something else from me. I still have my spirit. What I will say is that upon dragging my food home and unloading, I found that my furnished apartment did not feel that a can opener was necessary.

<strong>Behold - the solution to all of my (can related) problems</strong>
