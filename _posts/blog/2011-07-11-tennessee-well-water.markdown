A few years ago, a native of Tennessee passed on a recipe to me that I am now going to pass on to everyone! This is a fantastic party drink that everyone I have made this for speaks very highly of. The best part of it, it is very easy to prepare and can be made in an instant.

Word of caution: If you make this drink, please make sure that you drink responsibly. This drink has a tendency to sneak up on you.

<strong>Ingredients required:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>7 Lemons</li>
	<li>7 Limes</li>
	<li>750 ml Vodka (Try to get a good Vodka - Grey Goose or Столичная (<strong>Stolichnaya</strong>))</li>
	<li>4 L of Mountain Dew</li>
	<li>Large Punch Bowl</li>
	<li>Ice</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>About 2 hours prior to your party:</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>Cut each of the Lemons and Limes in Half. Take one half of each of the lemons and limes and squeeze out the juice. Make sure to filter out the seeds from the Lemons. Include pulp as desired. Take the other half of the citrus fruit and cut in quarters. Dump fruit slices and squeezed juice in punch bowl. Pour in 750ml of Vodka and let sit.</div>
<div><strong>About 15 minutes prior to your party:</strong></div>
<div>Pour out 4L of Mountain Dew into Punch Bowl. Include Ice. Stir.</div>
<div>This drink tastes very much like a pure Mountain Dew, and it is difficult if not unnoticeable to taste the alcohol in this drink. Enjoy!</div>
<div><em>Notes</em></div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Some people enjoy the pulp, and others do not. In an unknown setting, no pulp works better as enjoyers find themselves trying to filter it out.</li>
	<li>As the host, please be sure to take keys prior to letting patrons enjoy this drink.</li>
	<li>Throwback Mountain Dew (Pure Sugar) tends to taste better. Try to get this if you can. 1 Case is approximately 4L.</li>
	<li>You can substitute most clear alcohols for Vodka. I have been told Pure Grained Alcohol (PGA) is a good substitute.</li>
</ul>
