    <p>A young man I know named Adam asked me recently for a video of a garbage truck. He's fascinated by the things - trucks as well as heavy duty vehicles of all kinds. I just happened to see one recently, and grabbed a quick video. I'm sure it'll be different than what he's used to looking at, but it's interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>I'll also take other special requests - if there is something interesting that you would like to see that I haven't done yet, please drop me a note or make a comment. I'll do my best to find something.</p>
